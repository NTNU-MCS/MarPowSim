# MarPowSim
NTNU Marine Power System Simulator

The Marine Power systems Simulator (MarPowSim) is a Matlab/Simulink library for marine power systems developed in the Research Council of Norway (RCN) financed KMB project: 

   "Design and Verification of Control Systems for Safe and Energy-efficient Vessels with Hybrid Power Plants" 

Short name of the project was D2V. It was lead by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Department of Marine Technology in collaboration with Department of Engineering Cybernetics. Technical and financial partners in the project were Kongsberg Maritime AS and Det Norske Veritas AS (today DNV GL).

The library includes models for marine power system components such as diesel-generator sets, battery module, switchboards, breakers, electric thrusters, PMS, and various utility calculation modules.
